For this special post, I’ve asked my co-bloggers to list me all their top coffee places to study and I’ve assembled the ones that was in common on our lists.

Legend: &hearts; = the bloggers’ favourites 
 

## 1. La Finca Coffee & Office
**| &hearts; Laura**
**| &hearts; Trang**

| ADDRESS: 1067 Rue de Bleury, Montréal, QC H2Z 1N1 | Métro Place D’Armes

A favourite of mine because of the accessibility by metro, the coziness of the place and the instagrammy worth of everyshot and every angle! :D

**| &hearts; Kim S.**

I’ve  also written a whole post about this coffee shop [*here!*](../crewcollective "Crew")

| ADDRESS: 360 St Jacques St, Montreal, QC H2Y 2N1 | Métro Square-Victoria

This cute little gem is in the middle of Little Burgundy, accessible by metro (it takes around 6 mins walk). Freshly served coffee and their pastries are to die for! 


| ADDRESS: 2471 Notre-Dame St W, Montreal, QC H3J 1N6 | Métro Lionel-Groulx 

## &#10084; Other favourites from my co-bloggers 

- **Cafe Sfouf** : **Laura** has written a whole post about this coffee shop *[here](../cafesfouf)!*

- [**Cafe Larue & Fils**](https://www.facebook.com/caffedellavia) :
 A favourite of **Kim S** : *"People come with a laptop or a book. In the summer, Villeray is very lively because it’s a neighbourhood packed with young families and you can see kids running around or biking outside."*

Alright, now that you finished procrastinating on that study session, get your ass back there AND STUDY :D 

Happy finals y’all!
